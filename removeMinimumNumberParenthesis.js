 * Remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to make the input string valid. Return all possible results.
Note: The input string may contain letters other than the parentheses ( and ).
Example 1:
Input: "()())()"
Output: ["()()()", "(())()"]
Example 2:
Input: "(a)())()"
Output: ["(a)()()", "(a())()"]
Example 3:
Input: ")("
Output: [""]
